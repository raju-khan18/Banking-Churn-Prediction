# Banking-Churn-Prediction

## 📝 Overview
This project analyzes and predicts customer churn in the banking sector using machine learning techniques. It explores customer demographics, financial behavior, and engagement metrics to develop predictive models and actionable insights. The solution applies advanced imbalance handling methods (SMOTE, ADASYN) and customer segmentation using K-Means clustering.

The goal is to help banks identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies, reducing churn and increasing customer lifetime value.


## 🚀 Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends and relationships within customer data.

- Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest for churn prediction.

- Customer Segmentation: Grouped customers into three segments using K-Means clustering for deeper behavioral insights.

- Class Imbalance Handling: Compared SMOTE and ADASYN to improve model performance.

- Model Evaluation: Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Deployment Plan: Outlined steps to integrate the best model into CRM systems for real-time churn prediction.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Languages: Python

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE, ADASYN)

- Clustering: K-Means

- Version Control: Git, GitHub

- Notebook Environment: Google Colab

## 🔥 Key Results
Random Forest achieved 85% accuracy, outperforming Logistic Regression and KNN.

SMOTE was more effective than ADASYN in handling class imbalance.

Customer segmentation revealed that younger customers with lower balances are at higher churn risk.
